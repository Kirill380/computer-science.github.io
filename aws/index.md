# IAM

* Groups -- a collection of users under one set of permissions (permission as policy). As per IAM standards we create groups with permissions and then assign user to that group.

* Role -- you create roles and assign them to AWS resource (AWS resource example can be a customer, supplier, contractor, employee, an EC2 instance, some external application outside AWS) but remember you can't assign role to user.

> Groups are for living. Roles are for non-living.
